# Bank-Customer-Churn
As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one. This repository contains the code and documentation for a Bank Customer Churn Analysis project. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in a bank, helping the bank to identify and retain customers at risk of leaving.

# Project Description
Customer churn (attrition) is a critical concern for banks and financial institutions. It is more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. In this project, we aim to:

Analyze customer data to identify factors that contribute to churn.
Develop predictive models to forecast customer churn.
Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
We use machine learning techniques and data analysis to achieve these objectives.

# About Dataset

1. RowNumber—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
2. CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
3. Surname—the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
4. CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
5. Geography—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.

7. Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
8. Tenure—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.

10. NumOfProducts—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.

13. EstimatedSalary—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
